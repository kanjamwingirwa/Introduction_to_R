# Introduction_to_R
This is an independent Project to practise on R
The dataset analyzed will give us an idea on the probability of a user clicking on an ad. 
We shall clean the data, conduct univariate and bivariate analysis in order to determine this fact
Our metric for success will be classification of our data into various fields to help in determining who clicks an advert
